# The new TicketSwap

This app contains a front-end(react-redux) and a back-end(Node js/ Koa/ typescript). You can buy and sell tickets and add reviews on how your experience with the seller was. It will also directly calculate the risk you take with buying a ticket. This is based on how many tickets a seller has sold, how many comments there are for this seller and what the price is.
